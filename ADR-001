Images tagging strategy

dev-<sha>, stg-<sha>, prod<-sha>

dev-Development means new feature is being build.
stg-Staging means the feature is finished and it is being tested in environment similar to production.
prod-Production means finals environment where the app is working.

Sha means hash of particular commit.

Unique hash-> safe deployment-> easy to differ
