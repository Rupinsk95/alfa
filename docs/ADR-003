Decision:
I chose the ingress-nginx chart to deploy an Ingress Controller in the cluster.

Why this chart:

it’s the most popular and stable option,

works on any Kubernetes cluster,

easy to configure,

well-supported and well-documented.

Key values in values.yaml:

controller.replicaCount: 2 -> high availability,

controller.service.type: LoadBalancer -> external access,

resources -> CPU/RAM limits for stability,

Consequences:
The Ingress Controller is stable, and ready to handle external traffic.
